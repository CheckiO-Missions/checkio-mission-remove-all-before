    <div class="answer">
        First of all, you need to find the position of "border" in the list. Try to use "list.index()" method.

    <div class="answer">
        So, if you open your python console and say:
        <pre class="brush: python">
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.index(2)
        </pre>
        <p>You should get "1", because element "2" is on "1" position.</p>

    <div class="question">
        How can I use this in my code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You need to take a slice of list using "list.index(border)" as first element. And don't forget to check if "border" in list.

        One last question. How my final solution will look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <pre class="brush: python">
def remove_all_before(items: list, border: int) -> Iterable:
    if border in items:
        return items[items.index(border):]
    else:
        return items
        </pre>
        <p>Or you can do it in one line</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def remove_all_before(items: list, border: int) -> Iterable:
    return items[items.index(border):] if border in items else items
        </pre>

    </div>
